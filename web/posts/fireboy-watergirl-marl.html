          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Fireboy & Watergirl is a cooperative puzzle platformer where two characters must work together to reach their respective goals. Fireboy can only traverse fire elements; Watergirl can only traverse water elements. They often need to activate switches or hold doors open for each other.</p>
          <p>This game is an ideal setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) because success requires explicit coordination. Neither agent can solve the puzzles alone.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="multi-agent-rl">
          <h2>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</h2>
          <p>In MARL, multiple agents act in a shared environment. Each agent has its own policy and receives its own observations and rewards. The key challenge: the environment is non-stationary from each agent's perspective—other agents are learning and changing their behavior.</p>
          <p>We distinguish between cooperative (shared goal), competitive (zero-sum), and mixed settings. Fireboy & Watergirl is cooperative: both agents benefit from reaching the end together.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="fireboy-watergirl">
          <h2>The Fireboy & Watergirl Game</h2>
          <p>We'll use or build an environment that captures the core mechanics: two controllable characters, element-based obstacles, switches, doors, and level layouts. The state includes both characters' positions and the state of interactive elements.</p>
          <p>Actions are independent per agent (left, right, jump, or special). The reward can be sparse (only on level completion) or shaped (progress toward goals, staying alive).</p>
        </section>

        <section id="cooperation">
          <h2>Designing for Cooperation</h2>
          <p>Reward design is critical. A shared reward (both agents get +1 when both reach goals) encourages cooperation. Individual rewards can lead to selfish behavior. We might use reward shaping to guide early learning.</p>
          <p>Communication or centralized training can help. In centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE), we train with full state access but deploy with each agent seeing only its local observations.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="approaches">
          <h2>Learning Approaches</h2>
          <p>We can use independent Q-learning (IQL), where each agent treats others as part of the environment. Simple but can be unstable. Alternatively, value decomposition methods (VDN, QMIX) learn a joint value function from individual agent values.</p>
          <p>Policy gradient methods like MAPPO extend PPO to multi-agent settings. We'll compare a few approaches and discuss their trade-offs.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="implementation">
          <h2>Implementation Notes</h2>
          <p>Implementation involves a multi-agent environment wrapper, separate (or shared) networks per agent, and a training loop that collects experience from both agents. We need to handle variable-length episodes and partial observability.</p>
          <p>Curriculum learning can help: start with simpler levels where cooperation is minimal, then progress to puzzles that require tight coordination.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="results">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>We expect the agents to learn basic coordination: waiting for each other, activating switches in sequence, and avoiding hazards. Full level completion may require extensive training. We'll analyze learned behaviors and failure modes.</p>
